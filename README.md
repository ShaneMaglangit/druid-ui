# DruidUI

DruidUI is a collection of elegantly crafted React components, drawing inspiration from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and [PostHog's LemonUI](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog). Every component is designed to be easily copy-pasted into your project for maximum flexibility and customization.
