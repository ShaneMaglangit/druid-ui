# DruidUI

DruidUI is a collection of elegantly crafted React components, drawing inspiration from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and [PostHog's LemonUI](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog). Every component is designed to be easily copy-pasted into your project for maximum flexibility and customization.

**Pre-requisites:**

Here are the NPM dependencies that you will need to use DruidUI components:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
- [Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge)
- [Lucide React Icons](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide) (Optional)

## Philosophies

DruidUI is built with the following philosophies in mind:

- **Minimal dependencies:** DruidUI aims to minimize dependencies to keep your project lightweight and fast.
- **Fully customizable:** Having a copy-paste components instead of an NPM library, you get maximum control. Our opinions on components are just that, opinions.
- **Free and open-source:** DruidUI is free to use and open-source, so you can use it in your personal and commercial projects (we won't sue you, promise).
